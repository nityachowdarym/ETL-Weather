Project Content
dags: This folder contains the Python files for your Airflow DAGs. By default, this directory includes one example DAG:
example_astronauts: This DAG shows a simple ETL pipeline example that queries the list of astronauts currently in space from the Open Notify API and prints a statement for each astronaut. The DAG uses the TaskFlow API to define tasks in Python, and dynamic task mapping to dynamically print a statement for each astronaut. For more on how this DAG works, see our Getting started tutorial.
Dockerfile: This file contains a versioned Astro Runtime Docker image that provides a differentiated Airflow experience. If you want to execute other commands or overrides at runtime, specify them here.
include: This folder contains any additional files that you want to include as part of your project. It is empty by default.
packages.txt: Install OS-level packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
requirements.txt: Install Python packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
plugins: Add custom or community plugins for your project to this file. It is empty by default.
airflow_settings.yaml: Use this local-only file to specify Airflow Connections, Variables, and Pools instead of entering them in the Airflow UI as you develop DAGs in this project.
